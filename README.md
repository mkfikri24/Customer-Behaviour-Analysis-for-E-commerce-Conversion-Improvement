# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-for-E-commerce-Conversion-Improvement

## Overview:

RP is an e-commerce company that sells furniture and household needs, as well as official e-commerce for ACE Hardware, Informa Furnishings, Electronic Informa, Toys Kingdom, and others. To increase the number of conversions in the platform, RP started to track users' activity to gain deeper insight into how users engage across web, mobile, and app. The main objective of this project is to analyze the behaviour of the customer on the platform to understand how customers interact with the platform before doing a conversion and where do they drop off in the sales funnel to improve the quality and user experience in RP.

## SQL Objective:

To increase the number of conversions in the platform, RP started to track user's activity to gain deeper insight into how users engage across web, mobile, and app. Now we can find what users do at specific points in their user journey, which page or feature they drop off on, and which customer completes the conversion across any type of device / location by identifying specific individuals and pair this with Activity data for each unique User.

  1. Calculate the conversion rate of Paid Order from RP by dividing number of user who completed the transaction with number of user visited RP
  2. Calculate conversion rate by user's city
  3. Find which step of the customer journey has the highest drop rate (lowest conversion rate)

## Dashboard:
